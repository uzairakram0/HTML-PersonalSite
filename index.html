    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p margin-left="10px" margin-right="10px"> My name is Uzair Akram and I'm a CS major at UNT. This is a brief summary of advancement so far in the computer science 
      course work. I have taken fundamental of programming in C++, Object oriented programming in Java, Computing foundations: 
      which covers some data models and ADTs, discrete math, mathematical algorithm analysis, automata theory, graph theory, 
      combinatorics. I have also taken Digital Logic design covering computer hardware, logic gates, Integrated circuit 
      modules and binary system of data representation. I have also completed a course in computer organization, the course
      briefly covers computer architecture and different programming languages, compilation, virtual machine concept and primarily 
      focuses on low level assemlbly language programming using MASM(Microsoft Macro Assembler) on an x86 processor,  I'm also 
      currently taking courses in system programing, where i have learned bitwise programming using C, using scripting languages
      gawk and bash scripts, I'm currently learning processes and threads. Software engineering is also currentlly in progress,
      the focus is on the development process, gathering user stories and different diagrams for software development eg. class diagrams,
      activity diagrams, sequence diagrams etc. There is a major project designing a complete application program, for which we are
      to learn a programming language of our choice and build an application program with it. Another course this semester is
      data structures and algorithms. Where i learn different data structure such as linked lists, stacks queues, trees, heaps,
      hash tables and searching algorithms. My primary experience in programming is with Java, C++, and I study swift on 
      my own time for building iOS app development.<br>
        My journey in computer science began partially in seeking to understand and demystifying how computers work. My understanding
      of computers thus far is that a computer is a system of integrated circuits that can represent algorithmic logic; 
      execute commands or instructions from memory in a specific order. It can represent information and boolean logic using 
      binary states (either electrical current is passing through or not). It can also simulate mathematical logic and perform
      mathematical computations using adders, comparators, and other circuits. It also uses various digital logic circuits to 
      implement digital functions: decoders, encoders, multiplexers and demultiplexers.<br>
        As i advance through my degree plan, I plan to focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe this focus
      will present a good challenge and will help me build an understanding of computation as it relates to cognition.<br>
        Computer Science however is not a study of computers but a study of computation. Computers are a tool for performing 
      computations. Computation is methodology for producing imperative knowledge. Computation can be analogous to a mathematical
      function for a given set of inputs there is a defined output. Many professors say "Computation is both an art and a science"
      the creation of a computational procedure or algortihm is both a creative and a logical process. I think that computer science
      is a great field for me as it allows me to engages my mind in problem solving and critical thinking, which I enjoy.
